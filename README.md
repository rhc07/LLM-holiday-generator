# LLM-holiday-generator

This is a small project to demonstrate how to build an API in Go (Golang) that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate vacation ideas based on user preferences. The API uses the following parameters to personalise the suggestions:

- `favourite_season` (e.g., summer, winter)
- `hobbies` (e.g., hiking, photography, skiing, surfing)
- `budget` (e.g., 1000) - this unit is in USD ðŸ’°

## Key Features

- **User-friendly API** built using the [GinGonic](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework.
- **LLM Integration** powered by [LangchainGo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchaingo).
- **Unique Request Tracking** using Google's [UUID package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/uuid).

## Project Structure

```

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vacation.go    # Endpoint logic for vacation generation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types.go       # Request and response types for the vacation endpoints
â”œâ”€â”€ chains/          # Service layer for LLM and business logic

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.18 or later
- Access to an LLM service compatible with LangchainGo
- OpenAPI account and API Key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-vacation-api.git
   cd llm-vacation-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   go mod tidy && go mod vendor
   ```

3. Set up environment variables for the OPENAI API:

   Run this command in the terminal when you have your OPENAI key:

   - `export OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your API key for the OPENAI .

     **or**

   Create a `.env` file and add this variable:

   - `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key`

### Running the API

1. Start the server:

   ```
   go run main.go
   ```

2. The API will run on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### API Endpoint

    }
    ```
  - **Response** (JSON):
    ```json
    {
      "id": "f5aa253f-35e0-4110-9927-136c0464fe5e",
      "completed": false,
      "idea": ""
    }
    ```
- **GET `/vacations/:id`**
  - **Description**: Fetch vacation idea from mock database.
  - **Response** (JSON):
    ```json
    {
      "id": "ef5cbd33-97f0-4d50-9741-c8142b224870",

    }
    ```
